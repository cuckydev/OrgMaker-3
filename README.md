# OrgMaker 3
OrgMaker 3 is a sequencer for the Organya music format, designed by Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya.

# About
I did not create the Organya music format, but I did write the code for this project. I wrote all the code for reading, processing, and playing Organya songs myself, using Pixel's original code (which can be found at shbow/organya) as a reference for the quirks of Organya playback.
